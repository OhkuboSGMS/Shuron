Recent development of problem solving method by deep learning using neural network
Research is being conducted to apply deep learning to game level creation.

The amount of data set is important in machine learning, but at the existing game level
under 100 levels, an environment that can prepare more game levels
It is necessary to arrange.

Game level is generated from machine learning
The required dataset is not available in the existing environment,
Propose an environment that can provide a sufficient amount of level data set required for generation,
The purpose is to implement to realize the environment.
In the existing environment, the number of levels given for each game is 5 levels
In order to use the level expression method for learning, it was necessary to modify it.
For this reason, in this research, one game
Extract, analyze, visualize, and insert levels for machine learning
Implemented an environment that can change levels to make it easier to use.
Datasets that are easy to use for machine learning are actually used
Define undefined methods as data formats
We devised to be able to convert.


We changed the game level for Super Mario Maker-2.
Generate levels by machine learning by implementing extraction, insertion, and editing
As a result, a learning environment was constructed using GAN and generated by GAN.
The level was actually reflected in the game.


We  used Super Mario Maker-2 for level generation by machine learning.
We implemented the environment so that we could learn from the data
A new stage can be expected from the model.
To create a generation model to reduce the burden of level generation for level designers
Useful.
